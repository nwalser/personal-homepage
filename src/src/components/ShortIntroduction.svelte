<p>
    I am a 21 year old <span class="font-bold">fullstack developer</span> based in Saint Gallen,
    Switzerland. My fascination with technology and robotics has led me to pursue learning
    programming, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with
    the latest technologies. I have worked on a number of projects, including creating software
    algorightms with neuronal networks for surface inspection and quality assurance.

<p>
    Currently I am working part time for <span class="font-bold">esp-engineering gmbh</span>, where I am able to extend my
    knowledge in vision based algorigthms, operator interfaces, managing large datasets and many
    more areas.

<p>
    In addition to my work experience, I am also studying systems engineering at the <span class="font-bold">Zurich
        University of Applied Sciences</span> in Winterthur. Currently I am in the second semester.

    In my free time I fly quadrocopters and develop plugins for a fully autonomous autopilot.
