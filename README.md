# Personal Homepage
Hi there! This repository contains the full code of my personal homepage. It is fully written in SvelteKit. The publish branch gets automatically published with Vercel. 
You can reach the published site under: [https://www.nathaniel-walser.com/](https://www.nathaniel-walser.com/)

Feel free to have a look around the code. It isn't the most beautiful job that I've done up until now, but it does work and is blazingly fast.

# Motivation
Originally this project started because I wanted to learn the SvelteKit framework. Up until now I had a lot of fun doing it, therefore I will probably continue to extend this website.
